 # Skeet Selfbot 010923
 
 
 Skeet Selfbot 010923, also known as the "Feature Update", is probably one of the best selfbots for Discord ever known to history. With over 500+ commands, fast response time, what else could you expect? One of the 6 main features of Skeet Selfbot is:
 
 
 - Anti-Token Log
 - Multi-Threaded Raids (Up to 32 threads!)
 - Account Backup (Servers, Friends, to even your Bio)
 - Nitro Sniper
 - Account Utility
 - Root Permissions (su, preventing your account from being term'd)
